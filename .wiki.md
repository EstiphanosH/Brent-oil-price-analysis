# Project Summary
The project is developing a web application for change point analysis, specifically focused on how significant events impact Brent oil prices. It enables users to upload data, visualize trends, detect change points, and analyze correlations between events and price fluctuations, providing valuable insights for financial analysis and decision-making.

# Project Module Description
The application includes the following functional modules:
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload datasets for analysis.
- **Change Point Detection**: Algorithms are implemented to identify change points in the data.
- **Visualization**: Visual representations of the data, change points, and events are provided.
- **Event Analysis**: Analyze how different events impact oil prices.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports based on analysis results.
