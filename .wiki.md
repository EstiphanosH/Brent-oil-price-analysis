# Project Summary
The project aims to develop a web application focused on change point analysis. This application will help users identify points in time where the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change, providing valuable insights for data analysis across various domains.

# Project Module Description
The application will include modules for:
- **Data Upload**: Allow users to upload datasets for analysis.
- **Change Point Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect change points in the data.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual representations of the data and detected change points.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports based on the analysis results.

# Directory Tree

```

# File Description Inventory
- **Change point analysis.docx**: Contains detailed requirements and expectations for the change point analysis application.
- **Change point analysis (1).docx**: An earlier version of the analysis document.

# Technology Stack
- Web Framework: [Specify framework, e.g., Flask, Django]
- Frontend: [Specify technology, e.g., React, Angular]
- Data Analysis: [Specify libraries, e.g., NumPy, Pandas]
- Visualization: [Specify libraries, e.g., Matplotlib, D3.js]

# Usage
1. Install dependencies using the package manager.
